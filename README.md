# SMG2 Horror Restored
### Brings back the scrapped Bone's Curse powerup from the grave!

This is effectively a brand new powerup for SMG2, using bits and pieces of unused code that Nintendo left behind in the release.

Below is a list of everything included:
- The ObjectData archives for "Bone Mario", "Bone Luigi", the "Bone-shroom", the "Throwable-Bone", and the "Rib Switch".
- The LayoutData archive for the "Curse Meter".
- The "HorrorItem" object in the editor
- The "HorrorSwitch" object in the editor
- The "HorrorForbidThrowArea" area in the editor
- The "HorrorLimitArea" area in the editor
- The "Horror" comet type.
- An effect json for importing the Bone-Shroom's effects

Below is a list of other things that you will need:
- A level editor
- A Effect JSON supported particle editor
